Atelier Adventure

Description of the project:

Our team would like to implement a Web application that implements similar functionalities to Kanban or Trello. We would like to distinguish between Projects, Users and Tasks. A project will consist of multiple lists of tasks and it will involve multiple users. Each user would be able to login to his/her account and look at his/her projects. Additionally, users would have different roles in each project for example 'Developer' or 'Manager' with different functionalities. Each task would consist of a title and a description and other information relevant to the task such as due date. All of the created tasks will be located in one of the lists of the project which will be created depending on the needs of the user. Last but not least, we would like to implement both a mobile and a desktop version of the application.
In conclusion, we would like to use the skills acquired in Web Atelier 2018 to reach these goals but also manage to extend our knowledge by reaching various stretch goals such as having a discord bot for our application and maintaining a secure connection using HTTPS.
